The Songs app allows the user to have access to multiple songs in one place. The app provides the lyrics to each song, a photo of the ablum cover that the song belongs to, and a photo of the artist to refer to when listening. It also allows them to filter their favorite songs through the favorites button to see only their favorites when they chose. In addition to the favorites button, the app also displays like and dislike buttons for the user to mark down their feelings about the song at the time, but also be able to adjust as their opinion on each song changes. In case the user can't seem to find where the lyrics are located on the app, the "Lyrics" title is highlighted with a background of pink and yellow to be easily spotted. The user can also tap hard and hold on the image of the artist to reduce the size in order to see the rest of the album cover, and on release, the image will return to its normal size.
